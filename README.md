## Technologies Used

I've used Angular and Bootstrap 4.4.1 for this project. This project mainly covers the components communication, the data is passed between components to components by using the Input and Output decorators.

You can also store the data into localStorage by clicking the save button, which is placed in the navigation bar. If you want to store the data into the database, then you've to send that data to the server, once the button is clicked.

## Installation

After cloning the repo, do
```bash
npm install
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
